To do items are grouped in lists. Each list has a title. 

The app has three main views: 
    - The list views
    - the main views
    - the details views

Layout:
    - At the top of the main section is the title of the chosen list
    - I'm able to add a new item from the bottom
    - In desktop interface 
        - these views appear from left to right, with the sides of equal widths
        - the main view:
            - is in golden ratio raport with the other two
            - is not wider than 80 characters
        - when the sides become smaller than mobile width, changes to mobile view
    - In mobile interface:
        - by default the main view is visible
        - When I click on the title on top, a list with the titles appears
        - When I click on the details of an item, a form with the details appears.

The list view:
    - There's always a list by default which is titled "Reminders". 
    - Here I should be able to add, delete or modify their title. 
    - If I try to delete a list which is not empty, I should get a warning. 
    - When I click on a list, in the main section I see its items. 

The main view:
    - Has a toggle where I hide the completed items
    - Every item has a checkbox, a description, a delete button and a details button. 
    - I'ts also possible to create nested items. These don't have a details view. 
    - When I tick a checkbox, the item is striked through. 
    - If I tick the checkboxes of all sub-items, the item itself is ticked. And vice-versa. 

The details pane is like a form:
    - it contains a due date and time with date and time picker
    - it contains an input for the title and description / notes
    - the inputs are modifiable
    - optionally I can add a location and image
    - for the mobile interface, this form appears as a dialog
